        <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
        <section>


We believe that voting is a fundamental right, and that felony disenfranchisement laws, which are rooted in a system of structural injustice, infringe upon that right and present yet another barrier to re-entry for those with past felony convictions. Free To Voteâ€™s mission is to educate the public about the history, practice and consequences of felony disenfranchisement; to provide information about voting rights restoration in each state; and to offer resources and support for those seeking to restore and/or exercise their right to vote.
